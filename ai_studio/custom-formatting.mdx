## Custom Formatting

**Custom Formatting** allows providers to personalize how their notes are generated. By setting specific formatting instructions, you can ensure the output consistently reflects your clinical style, preferences, and workflow needs.

### What It Does

Custom formatting applies note-by-note instructions to the AI, as if you were guiding a human scribe. These rules impact how the note is structured, phrased, and presented.

For example, you can instruct the system to:

- Bold all section headers
- Use bullet points in the plan
- Include gender-based salutations (e.g., “Mr” or “Mrs”)
- Number the patient’s next steps
- Add specific formatting for medications or vitals

> The model will follow these instructions every time it generates a note for the selected template.

### How to Set It Up

1. Navigate to **Custom Formatting** under the AI Studio.
2. Select the note template (e.g., SOAP Note, Progress Note).
3. Use the prompt box to type your rules (up to 4,000 characters).
4. Click **Save Rules**.

You can also click **"See more example rules"** for inspiration.

### Notes

- Formatting rules only apply to future scribe generations.
- To apply updated rules to a past note, you must **regenerate** that note.
- Each template can have its own formatting rules—great for specialists or multi-format teams.

---

### Examples of Useful Rules

```
- Use bullet points for all sections except Subjective.
- End each note with “Follow-up as needed.”
- Avoid abbreviations for diagnoses.
- Always refer to the patient as “the patient” (not “Pt.”).
```

## Formatting Examples

### Custom-formatting what content to include, add, or remove

- _"Create a numbered problem list based on the Subjective and Objective sections."_
- _"After the Assessment section, add a section called Assessment/Objective that includes a one-paragraph summary combining the Assessment and Objective sections, justifying the need for continued PT (unless the patient is to be discharged)."_
- _"Create a list of patient goals and/or progress toward goals based on the Subjective and Objective sections."_
- _"Under the heading Neuromuscular Re-education, create a comma-separated list of all neuromuscular re-education performed."_
- _"Under the heading Therapeutic Activities, create a comma-separated list of all therapeutic activities performed."_
- _"Under the heading Dry Needling, create a comma-separated list of all muscles released through dry needling and/or dry needling protocols used. If electrical stimulation was used with needling, include the duration."_
- _"Create the Assessment as a narrative describing what the PT did that day and how the patient responded."_
- _"Always document the general exam."_
- _"If I am speaking to the scribe before the start of a visit, all information discussed should be included in the documentation."_

### Custom formatting writing style

- _"When documenting pain levels, write them as a number out of 10 using numerals."_
- _"Never write the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, or Plan in a numbered list."_
- _"Refer to the patient by their name instead of 'patient'."_
- _"Never write a note in the first person."_
- _"Always abbreviate physical therapy as 'PT'."_
- _"The provider addressing the patient is always the physical therapist."_
- _"Refer to the PT as 'Therapist'."_
