## Custom Formatting

**Custom Formatting** allows providers to personalize how their notes are generated. By setting specific formatting instructions, you can ensure the output consistently reflects your clinical style, preferences, and workflow needs.

### What It Does

Custom formatting applies note-by-note instructions to the AI, as if you were guiding a human scribe. These rules impact how the note is structured, phrased, and presented.

For example, you can instruct the system to:

- Bold all section headers
- Use bullet points in the plan
- Include gender-based salutations (e.g., “Mr” or “Mrs”)
- Number the patient’s next steps
- Add specific formatting for medications or vitals

> The model will follow these instructions every time it generates a note for the selected template.

### How to Set It Up

1. Navigate to **Custom Formatting** under the **Customize**.
2. Select the note template (e.g., SOAP Note, Progress Note).
3. Use the prompt box to type your rules (up to 4,000 characters).
4. Click **Save Rules**.

You can also click **"See more example rules"** for inspiration.

### Keep in Mind

- Formatting rules only apply to future scribe generations.
- To apply updated rules to a past note, you must **regenerate** that note.
- Each template can have its own formatting rules—great for specialists or multi-format teams.

## Formatting Examples

### How to include, add, or remove content

- _"Create a numbered problem list based on the Subjective and Objective sections."_
- _"Use bullet points for all sections except Subjective."_
- _"Avoid abbreviations for diagnoses."_
- _"End each note with 'Follow-up as needed.'”_
- _"Create a list of patient goals and/or progress toward goals based on the Subjective and Objective sections."_
- _"Under the heading Neuromuscular Re-education, create a comma-separated list of all neuromuscular re-education performed."_
- _"Always document the general exam."_
- _"If I am speaking to the scribe before the start of a visit, all information discussed should be included in the documentation."_

### Custom formatting writing style

- _"When documenting pain levels, write them as a number out of 10 using numerals."_
- _"Never write the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, or Plan in a numbered list."_
- _"Never write a note in the first person."_
- _"Always abbreviate physical therapy as 'PT'."_

## Learned Formatting

Learned formatting allows you to add in "gold standard" notes per each note section to influence our model in generating future notes for that template. Whithin your note, you can edit into what it _could have been_ and star it so it gets automatically added as a standard structurally for future notes in that template. You can paste in example notes, giving you more control over how notes are organised and presented, and expedite the journey to your perfect note.

## Passive Learning

Passive Learning helps our model understand provider behavior when they edit a note,  Passive Learning is a system that learns from provider edits over time to automatically suggest rules and changes, adapting and improving note generation. It captures, interprets, and applies changes made by providers without requiring explicit feedback, with the goal of reducing future edits and increasing note satisfaction.

There are two ways a provider can add suggestions to their account:

1. By accepting suggestions from the **Smart Suggestion popup (displayed after login)**
2. By accepting suggestions from the **Customize → Smart Suggestions screen**

The popup is designed to appear only once per week, while suggestions remain accessible at any time in the Smart Suggestions screen.
