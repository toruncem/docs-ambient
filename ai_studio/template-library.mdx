### Favorite vs. Custom Templates

Templates in the Template Library are grouped into two categories:

- **Favorite Templates**
  These are the templates that appear in the template dropdown on the **Visit page**. Providers can reorder these templates to suit their workflow.
- **Custom Templates**
  These are provider-built templates created using the “Build Custom Template” tool. They are unique to each user and fully configurable.

To switch between views, use the **Favorite / Custom** tabs at the top of the Template Library.

### Template Builder UI (Custom Template Creation)

When building a custom template:

- **Template Title**: Required name of the template.
- **Description**: Optional one-line summary to help identify the template’s purpose.
- **Section Title**: Label for each section (e.g., "Objective", "Findings").
- **Section Content**: Field where you describe how the section should be filled out. Include guidance, formatting expectations, or placeholders.

Use the **\+ Add Section** or **🗑 Delete Section** buttons to manage structure.

Click **Save Edit** to finalize your template and begin using it immediately.

> Custom templates are ideal for specialized workflows, niche clinical content, or specific documentation structures required by individual providers or departments.
