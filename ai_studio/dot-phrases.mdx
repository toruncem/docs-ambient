## Dot Phrases

The **Dot Phrases** feature allows you to configure shortcut audio triggers that automatically expand into longer phrases during documentation. This helps streamline note creation and reduce repetitive typing.

### What is a Dot Phrase?

A dot phrase pairs a **short audio cue** with a **predefined expanded phrase**. When the audio trigger is detected during documentation, the expanded text will be inserted automatically into the note.

For example:

- **Audio Trigger:** `belly`
- **Expanded Phrase:** `abdomen`

### Creating or Editing a Dot Phrase

</Frame>

To create a new dot phrase or edit an existing one:

1. **Audio Trigger**:
   - Enter the voice command you want to use (e.g., `belly`, `heart sounds good`).
   - This should be short, unique, and easy to say clearly.
2. **Expanded Phrase**:
   - Input the full text you want inserted when the trigger is recognized (up to 2000 characters).
   - You can include clinical shorthand, normal findings, or repetitive language blocks.
3. **Apply to Template**:
   - Select the template this dot phrase should be active in (e.g., SOAP Note).
   - Dot phrases are template-specific to prevent accidental cross-template usage.
4. Click **Save Dot Phrase** to confirm your changes.

### Deleting a Dot Phrase

To delete an existing dot phrase, simply click the **Delete** button in the bottom-right corner of the phrase editor.

<Warning>
  Deleting a dot phrase is permanent. Youâ€™ll need to re-create it from scratch if needed later.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- Use clear, specific audio triggers to reduce misinterpretation.
- Avoid using single syllable triggers like "a", "no", or "the".
- Test your dot phrases in the context of actual note generation to confirm expected behavior.
