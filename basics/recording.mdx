## How to start a recording

After logging into [scribe.athelas.com](http://scribe.athelas.com), you will land on the Visits page by default. If you navigate away, you can always return via the ‘My Visits’ tab in the side navigation.

1. To start a new recording, navigate to ‘New Visit.’
2. Enter the patient’s name in the designated text box.
3. Select the appropriate template from the drop-down menu based on the type of visit.\
   Choose the visit type—either in-person or virtual.
   - For in-person visits, that means two external voices are being picked up by the recording device.
   - For virtual visits, one voice is external and one is from the device.
4. Once those selections are made, click "Start Recording".

Athelas Scribe allows you to record in a 3 hour multi-speaker conversational setting, with the most advanced real-time speech recognition technology in the world.

## The recording screen

When you start recording, you will see a blue screen with the following information:

- _Top of the screen:_ Patient name, template, recording device (drop down)
- _Middle of the screen:_ Recording length, sound wave animation
- _Bottom of the screen:_ Pause recording (button), end visit (button)Recording length

You must record for **at least 20 seconds**, but recordings can last up to three hours.\
When you’re done, you can either pause, end the visit, or start another visit.
