### Regenerating a note to apply custom formatting or template changes

1. Locate the completed Scribe you want to update on the My Scribes page.
2. Click on the “AI Actions” button.
3. Select “Change Template” from the menu.
4. In the template selection window, choose a different template (any template other than the current one).
5. Click “Regenerate Scribe” to apply the change.
6. Once the Scribe has regenerated with the new template, repeat the process:
   - Click “AI Actions” again.
   - Select “Change Template.”
   - This time, select the original template you want to use.
   - Click “Regenerate Scribe” once more.
7. The Scribe will now be regenerated with the original template, and any new custom formatting or template updates will be applied to the historical note.

**Note:** This process is useful when you want to apply updated formatting or template changes to notes that were completed before those updates were available.

### Use Smart Edit to add or record additional context

You can add context or details that were not said out loud in the original recording and regenerate the note to reflect this information.
