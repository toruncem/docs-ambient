## Visits

The **Visits** tab allows integrated users to view, manage, and record scribe notes based on patient appointments pulled directly from their EMR. You can also manually create visits if needed.

### EMR-Integrated Visit Workflow

If your site is integrated with an EMR, appointments will automatically appear in the **Visits** tab for the current day.

Each appointment displays:

- Patient name
- Date of birth
- Appointment time
- Scribe status (e.g., Completed, Incomplete)

To start documenting:

1. Select the patient from the list.
2. Tap **Record New Scribe** at the bottom of the screen.
3. Choose your template, confirm visit type (In-Person or Virtual), and verify that you have patient consent.
4. Tap **Start Recording** to begin the visit.

> Integration ensures all visit data is synchronized with your EHR system in real time.

### Manually Adding a Visit

If you’re not integrated or need to document an unscheduled visit:

1. Click the **Add Visit** button.
2. Fill in the visit details:
   - Patient name
   - Date of birth
   - Gender
   - EHR ID (if applicable)
   - Date, Start Time, and End Time
3. Click **Save Visit**.
4. The visit will now appear in your list, where you can begin scribing as usual.

> Manually added visits are only visible within Athelas Scribe and do not sync to external EMRs unless custom integration is configured.
