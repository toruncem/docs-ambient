</Update>

<Update label="August 11th-25th, 2025">
  This release is all about giving you significantly **more customizability and quality** in the types of notes you create and the visits you scribe for. From easier-to-use note-level formatting, injecting your own gold standards, and configurable carry forward rules, we’re powering Ambient to be more robust across the documentation pipeline.

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="New Added Features" icon="sparkles">
      <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Note Level Preferences" icon="sparkles">
          Note Level Preferences was built from sourcing common custom formatting themes across our user-base and decoupling them into an easy-to-use bar.

          The goal is to simplify the process to set basic rules allowing you to specify how detailed you’d like your notes to be or whether you prefer bulleted, numbered, or narrative form.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title=" Carry Forward Configuration Page" description="You may have seen or used our carry forward feature already!" icon="sparkles">
          Now you can create your own user-specific rules to dictate what sections carry forward from the previous appointment for that patient and the resulting behavior. Here are example rules:

          - Carry forward and **append** the **HPI** from the previous note into the **HPI** of the current note
          - **Blend** the **A/P** of the previous note and the **HPI** of the current note.
            - Yes, you can carry forward between different sections\!
            - And yes, we can do intelligently “blend” content while retaining relevant dates, using past tense for previous content — only utilizing medically relevant context.
          - Carry forward and **prepend** the **ROS** of the previous note to the **ROS** of the current note.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Toggle Carry Forward On/Off Per Note" description="If a particular visit will have content carry-forwarded into, we will show a toggle for you to know." icon="sparkles">
          1. If carry forward is enabled for the upcoming appointment
          2. A preview of the previous note with an indication which section will be carry-forwarded

          We identify what visit is “eligible” to have _carry forward_ based on if we have the previous note for your patient. If you are integrated with an EMR for which we are pulling in signed notes, the “previous note” that is used in carry forward will your final, completed note — even if you didn’t use Ambient previously.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Learned Formatting" description="Learned Formatting now is in your hands! You can add in gold standard notes per section which our model will use to influence future notes for that template." icon="sparkles">
          Within your note, you can also edit (as per usual) into what it _could have been_ and star it so it gets automatically added as a standard structurally for future notes in that template.

          Even if you are or you’re onboarding a brand new user, you can paste in example notes to expedite the journey to your perfect note\!

          This feature gives users more control over how notes are organized and presented.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Auto-Send (or Scheduled-Send) Note to MDS" icon="sparkles">
          We offer the option for providers to send notes to an MDS immediately after it is generated, or schedule-send it X minutes after completion or every day at a particular time. We are bringing robust customizability to this flow for users it is beneficial for.
        </Accordion>
      </AccordionGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Coming Soon" icon="hourglass-half">
      - **Provider Re-engagement Emails** – Automatically reach out to providers to re-engage them to the app or teach them about key features.
      - **UI Tour During Onboarding** – Guide new users through key app features with a quick, gamified walkthrough.
      - **Passive Learning** – System suggest features to improve note quality by learning from user edits automatically.
      - **Macros Configuration** — We support injecting macros currently in our backend processes during note generation. But we are building out the necessary infrastructure to give you the power to view, edit, and add your own\!
      - **MDS Messaging** — Realtime messaging between providers and an MDS to discuss and edit notes.
      - **Chunking** – Faster, smarter transcription by breaking long audio into optimized segments.

<Update label="July 11th, 2025">
  We're back with another powerful Ambient release—this one's loaded with personalization, better workflows, and a smoother experience across the board.

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="New Added Features" icon="sparkles">
      <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Copilot" description="Copilot, a feature we launched recently, has doubled down on trust and usability. " icon="sparkles">
          - Copilot responses are now generated from only 50 trusted medical sources like FDA, CDC and NIH
          - Each copilot response consists of references and citations that provide its true/accurate source of information
          - Prompt suggestions for each user are now dynamic. This means we can change suggestions for each user/specialty type to encourage higher usage
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Preferences" description="Users can now fully customize how Ambient behaves with the new Preferences panel, accessible under Menu → Account → Preferences on mobile or the left nav on web." icon="sparkles">
          You can now:

          - Select your **primary note template**, which updates the default template shown when starting a new scribe
          - Enable or disable features like **Carry Forward**, **Highlight Differences**, **Face ID**, and **Two-Step Verification**
          - Set up preferences like **patient pronouns**, **signature**, or the need for **patient consent.**

          Changes persist across sessions, with discard warnings to prevent accidental loss of settings.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="After Visit Summaries (AVS)" description="Ambient now supports generating and sending **After Visit Summaries** directly from the app." icon="sparkles">
          Users can:

          - Manually generate an AVS tied to a specific note template
          - Edit the content of the summary before sending
          - Securely email the summary to the patient with one click
          - Automatically generate AVS for each visit by linking templates and enabling a flag

          This delivers a polished, patient-friendly post-visit communication experience.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Expanse V2 Writeback" description="Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness (PDOC) Flow" icon="sparkles">
          When syncing a note back into MEDITECH Expanse, users may now encounter multiple possible PDOC targets. Instead of a generic sync error, the user will now see a **popup with all valid documents**, allowing them to select the correct one to write into. Once selected, the note syncs as usual.

          This eliminates ambiguity and improves reliability for Expanse writebacks.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Regenerate Without New Context" description="You can now retry note generation without needing to update the input text." icon="sparkles">
          Just open **AI Actions → Smart Edit**, leave the context box empty, and click regenerate. You'll get a new version of the note based on the same conversation.

          This is especially useful when the initial output needs refinement without new edits.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Citations" description="Ambient now supports source citations for every line of the generated note. When enabled, you'll see markers next to each sentence." icon="sparkles">
          Clicking them reveals:

          - The exact part of the transcript the content was pulled from
          - An overlay to review the audio context
          - A jump link to highlight the cited content in the transcript tab

          This improves trust, audit-ability, and quick editing.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="In-App Notifications for Outages" description="Ambient now delivers real-time in-app banners during application outages or service disruptions—eliminating the need for manual emails or follow-ups." icon="sparkles">
          Banners are:

          - Automatically refreshed every 5 minutes
          - Targeted by site, EHR, device, or platform
          - Severity-based: ranging from minor dismissible alerts to critical non-dismissible warnings

          Admins can manage outages directly through our internal Retool dashboard.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Revamped Onboarding Flow" description="First-time users signing up without Google or SSO now walk through a modern onboarding experience:" icon="sparkles">
          In this new flow, users:

          - Select clinical specialty and EHR system
          - Add organization name and optionally book a live demo
          - End with a welcome screen and land directly in the app

          This ensures new users get a personalized, streamlined introduction to Ambient.
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion title='HCC "MEAT" Highlighting' description="Ambient now helps providers ensure accurate Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) documentation by analyzing whether the note meets MEAT (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess, Treat) criteria for each documented HCC code." icon="sparkles">
          Here's how it works:

          - HCCs are pulled from the patient's problem list after the visit
          - The note is automatically scanned to determine which MEAT components are present
          - A visual UI shows which components are met or missing for each HCC
          - Supporting rationale is extracted from the note
          - Providers can dictate or manually add missing elements, and the system re-runs the analysis in real time

          This feature is designed to support risk adjustment workflows and maximize completeness for value-based care models.
