    <Step title="Macros Iterations" icon="sparkles">
      We have expanded the functionality for provider-facing Physical Exam/Review Of Systems macros in product!

      - Toggling: providers can activate or de-activate macros. This allows our ops partners to set up macros at scale, and ensure that macros only apply to visits when each provider is ready.
      - Subsections: Providers can now add multiple subsections under a specific section.
      - Include additional systems: If enabled, macro content will include additional systems that were discussed but not explicitly listed in the macro.
      - Static + dynamic content: Providers can add both dynamic (after a colon) and static content to a macro.
      - Incorporating additional sections: Macros can appear under templates with nested sections
      - Multiple macros: Multiple macros can trigger for one section, where macro priority can be set through retool.
      - Help icon: By clicking the help icon next to the name at the top, providers are navigated to our online help center.

      - Auto-save: Automatically saves changes when tapping outside fields and properly handles nested template fields with tap-to-edit functionality. This eliminates the requirement of using explicit save buttons for individual fields, creating a more intuitive, document-like editing experience.
      - Tab: Providers can skip through sections by clicking the “tab” key, increasing speed.

<Update label="October 27th, 2025">
  This release was categorized into two groups: feature iteration and quality of life. Feature iteration stems from our conducting user interviews and collaborations with our operations team to increase usability and adoption for existing, core features. Quality of life releases are small features that continuously improve the provider experience on Commure Ambient.
</Update>

<Expandable title="10/27/2025 - Feature Iterations">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Carry Forward Iterations" icon="sparkles">
      Carry Forward lets providers copy or integrate notes from previous visits. Based on feedback from providers and Ops, we’ve expanded access, reliability, and discoverability:

      - Collaborator view: Collaborators can now access and enable Carry Forward for their provider.
      - Scribe fallback: If a signed note isn’t available, we use the last scribe-generated note.
      - Discovery: Added an educational popup for providers who haven’t yet set up Carry Forward.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Site Level Dictionary" icon="sparkles">
      A two-tier dictionary system allows site admins to create site-wide word correction mappings, while individual providers can maintain their own personal correction mappings. Site dictionary entries take precedence and prevent users from creating conflicting personal entries.

      ![Image(26) Pn](/images/image\(26\).png)

      Benefits:

      - Integrate pre-visit summary into existing workflows, instead of requiring extra steps for enablement. Previously, providers had to add appointments the day before in order to have a summary available.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Site-Specific Patient Consent" icon="sparkles">
      Sites can determine whether they want to surface the checkbox to providers related to obtaining consent.

      ![Image(28) Pn](/images/image\(28\).png)

<Update label="August 25th, 2025">
  This release is all about giving you significantly **more customizability and quality** in the types of notes you create and the visits you scribe for. From easier-to-use note-level formatting, injecting your own gold standards, and configurable carry forward rules, we’re powering Ambient to be more robust across the documentation pipeline.
</Update>

<Expandable title="08/25/2025">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Note Level Preferences" icon="sparkles">
      Note Level Preferences was built from sourcing common custom formatting themes across our user-base and decoupling them into an easy-to-use bar.

      The goal is to simplify the process to set basic rules allowing you to specify how detailed you’d like your notes to be or whether you prefer bulleted, numbered, or narrative form.

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcwoR0hDozo?si=StYvQB2B1900GAHG &mute=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
    </Step>
    <Step title=" Carry Forward Configuration Page" icon="sparkles">
      You may have seen or used our carry forward feature already! Now you can create your own user-specific rules to dictate what sections carry forward from the previous appointment for that patient and the resulting behavior. Here are example rules:

      - Carry forward and **append** the **HPI** from the previous note into the **HPI** of the current note
      - **Blend** the **A/P** of the previous note and the **HPI** of the current note.
        - Yes, you can carry forward between different sections!
        - And yes, we can do intelligently “blend” content while retaining relevant dates, using past tense for previous content — only utilizing medically relevant context.
      - Carry forward and **prepend** the **ROS** of the previous note to the **ROS** of the current note.

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rzKdt26dnc?si=PoyG8GiRovQIFfGC &mute=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Toggle Carry Forward On/Off Per Note" icon="sparkles">
      If a particular visit will have content carry-forwarded into, we will show a toggle for you to know:

      1. If carry forward is enabled for the upcoming appointment
      2. A preview of the previous note with an indication which section will be carry-forwarded

      We identify what visit is “eligible” to have _carry forward_ based on if we have the previous note for your patient. If you are integrated with an EMR for which we are pulling in signed notes, the “previous note” that is used in carry forward will your final, completed note — even if you didn’t use Ambient previously.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Learned Formatting" icon="sparkles">
      Learned Format allows users to select sections from an existing note as examples of preferred formatting. These selections are used to guide how future notes are structured and styled.

      - Choose specific sections to serve as formatting templates
      - Helps maintain consistency across notes
      - Adapts to individual documentation preferences over time

      This feature gives users more control over how notes are organized and presented.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Auto-Send (or Scheduled-Send) Note to MDS" icon="sparkles">
      We offer the option for providers to send notes to an MDS immediately after it is generated, or schedule-send it X minutes after completion or every day at a particular time. We are bringing robust customizability to this flow for users it is beneficial for.

      - Map spoken terms to preferred spellings or formats
      - Helps reduce repeated transcription errors
      - Custom entries apply automatically during transcription

      This feature ensures greater consistency and control across your transcripts.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Carry Forward Diff View" icon="sparkles">
      Carry Forward Diff View highlights the differences between a previous note and the content carried forward into a new one. It allows users to quickly see:

      - Exactly what content was reused from the prior note
      - What’s been added, removed, or changed in the new note
      - How the carried-forward content fits into the current context

      This makes it easier to review carry forward notes with confidence, especially in ongoing care scenarios.

    <Step title="PT Chart Review" icon="sparkles">
      PT Chart Review helps ensure documentation meets compliance standards by evaluating each note against a set of specific criteria.

      - Automatically checks for required content based on specified guidelines
      - Assigns a compliance grade to help providers identify gaps

      This feature supports more complete, audit-ready documentation and helps reinforce best practices in PT workflows.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Learned Format" icon="sparkles">
      Learned Format allows users to select sections from an existing note as examples of preferred formatting. These selections are used to guide how future notes are structured and styled.

      - Choose specific sections to serve as formatting templates
      - Helps maintain consistency across notes
      - Adapts to individual documentation preferences over time

      This feature gives users more control over how notes are organized and presented.

<Update label="July 14th, 2025">
  We're back with another powerful Ambient release—this one's loaded with personalization, better workflows, and a smoother experience across the board.
</Update>

<Expandable title="07/14/2025">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Copilot" icon="sparkles">
      Copilot, a feature we launched recently, has doubled down on trust and usability.

      - Copilot responses are now generated from only 50 trusted medical sources like FDA, CDC and NIH
      - Each copilot response consists of references and citations that provide its true/accurate source of information
      - Prompt suggestions for each user are now dynamic. This means we can change suggestions for each user/specialty type to encourage higher usage

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RR9LVcZ-RWQ?si=UU7_MP0etXiuL-_4 &mute=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Preferences" icon="sparkles">
      Users can now fully customize how Ambient behaves with the new **Preferences** panel, accessible under **Menu → Account → Preferences** on mobile or the left nav on web.

      You can now:

      - Select your **primary note template**, which updates the default template shown when starting a new scribe
      - Enable or disable features like **Carry Forward**, **Highlight Differences**, **Face ID**, and **Two-Step Verification**
      - Set up preferences like **patient pronouns**, **signature**, or the need for **patient consent.**

      Changes persist across sessions, with discard warnings to prevent accidental loss of settings.

    </Step>
    <Step title="After Visit Summaries (AVS)" icon="sparkles">
      Ambient now supports generating and sending **After Visit Summaries** directly from the app. Users can:

      - Manually generate an AVS tied to a specific note template
      - Edit the content of the summary before sending
      - Securely email the summary to the patient with one click
      - Automatically generate AVS for each visit by linking templates and enabling a flag

      This delivers a polished, patient-friendly post-visit communication experience.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Expanse V2 Writeback – PDOC Flow" icon="sparkles">
      When syncing a note back into MEDITECH Expanse, users may now encounter multiple possible PDOC targets. Instead of a generic sync error, the user will now see a **popup with all valid documents**, allowing them to select the correct one to write into. Once selected, the note syncs as usual.

      This eliminates ambiguity and improves reliability for Expanse writebacks.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Regenerate Without New Context" icon="sparkles">
      You can now **retry note generation** without needing to update the input text. Just open **AI Actions → Smart Edit**, leave the context box empty, and click regenerate. You'll get a new version of the note based on the same conversation.

      This is especially useful when the initial output needs refinement without new edits.

      ![Image(20) Pn](/images/image\(20\).png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Citations" icon="sparkles">
      Ambient now supports **source citations** for every line of the generated note. When enabled, you’ll see markers next to each sentence. Clicking them reveals:

      - The exact part of the transcript the content was pulled from
      - An overlay to review the audio context
      - A jump link to highlight the cited content in the transcript tab

      This improves trust, audit-ability, and quick editing.

    </Step>
    <Step title=" In-App Notifications for Outages" icon="sparkles">
      Ambient now delivers real-time **in-app banners** during application outages or service disruptions—eliminating the need for manual emails or follow-ups.

      Banners are:

      - Automatically refreshed every 5 minutes
      - Targeted by site, EHR, device, or platform
      - Severity-based: ranging from minor dismissible alerts to critical non-dismissible warnings

      Admins can manage outages directly through our internal Retool dashboard.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Revamped Onboarding Flow" icon="sparkles">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KKR3CeEgWU?si=I6hdn-p3rWXR0aOd &mute=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />
    </Step>
    <Step title='HCC "MEAT" Highlighting' icon="sparkles">
      Ambient now helps providers ensure accurate Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) documentation by analyzing whether the note meets **MEAT (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess, Treat)** criteria for each documented HCC code.

      Here's how it works:

      - HCCs are pulled from the patient’s problem list after the visit
      - The note is automatically scanned to determine which MEAT components are present
      - A visual UI shows which components are met or missing for each HCC
      - Supporting rationale is extracted from the note
      - Providers can dictate or manually add missing elements, and the system re-runs the analysis in real time

      This feature is designed to support risk adjustment workflows and maximize completeness for value-based care models.
