## Functionality

**Assistant Note Editing** enables the AI Assistant to detect intent when users want to modify specific sections of their clinical note, providing a structured interaction model.

### Intent Detection

- **Automatically identifies which section a user wants to change.**
- For example, if a user types _"Make the subjective section bulleted,"_ the system recognizes the target section immediately.

---

### Apply/Revert Workflow

- The Assistant responds with an **"Update" bubble**.
- Once applied, users can **"Revert"** to the original text if the edit isn't desired.

---

### Update Behavior

- **Only one active update per section.**
- If a user applies a different message's update to the same section, the **previous update is automatically unapplied**.

<Info>
  **Note:** This logic prevents conflicting edits by ensuring the most recent applied change takes precedence for a specific section.
