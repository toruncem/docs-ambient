---

Commure Dictation is designed to work with any application—no EHR-specific configuration required.

## How It Works

1. Open your EHR and navigate to the text field where you want to enter text (e.g., a progress note, assessment, or plan).
2. Click inside the text field to place your cursor.
3. Press and hold your dictation hotkey (default: `Ctrl + Space`).
4. Speak naturally. Text appears in real-time at your cursor position.
5. Release the hotkey to stop dictation.

You may also press your `start dictation` hotkey to keep the recording going without you holding down continuously. Use your `stop dictation` hotkey, or click the end button, to finalize your recording.

## Citrix Environments

If your organization accesses the EHR through Citrix Workspace, Commure Dictation automatically detects the Citrix session and routes text through a dedicated virtual channel for reliable injection.

### Connection Indicators

- A banner appears if Citrix mode is active but not connected.
- If connection is lost during a session, you'll see a notification with reconnection options.

### Troubleshooting Citrix

- Ensure Citrix Workspace is running before launching Commure Dictation.
- If text is not appearing, try clicking directly into the target text field and re-establishing focus.
- Contact your IT administrator if connection issues persist.
