description: "How Commure Dictation syncs with Commure Ambient for a unified documentation experience."
---

Commure Dictation is part of the Commure platform. If you use Commure Ambient for AI-generated clinical notes, your settings and content sync automatically.

## What Syncs

- **Macros** — Create once, use in both applications
- **Personal Dictionary** — Word corrections apply everywhere
- **Account settings** — Single source of truth across all Commure products

## Unified Workflow

Use Commure Ambient for full encounter documentation with AI-generated notes. Use Commure Dictation for quick edits, addendums, or documentation in applications where you need precise cursor control. Your customizations follow you across both tools.
