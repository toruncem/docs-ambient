Macros let you insert pre-defined text blocks using a simple voice trigger. Say a short phrase, and an entire template appears—complete with placeholders you can tab through and fill in.

## Creating a Macro

1. Navigate to **Settings > Macros**.
2. Click **New Macro**.
3. Enter an **Audio Trigger**—the phrase you'll speak to activate the macro (e.g., "physical exam normal").
4. Enter the **Macro Content**—the text that will be inserted.
5. Click **Save**.

## Using Placeholders

Placeholders let you create dynamic templates with fill-in-the-blank fields. When the macro is inserted, the first placeholder is automatically selected. Say "tab" to move to the next placeholder.

**Placeholder syntax:** `{{placeholder name}}`

**Example macro content:**

```
PHYSICAL EXAM:
General: {{general appearance}}
HEENT: {{HEENT findings}}
Cardiovascular: {{cardiovascular findings}}
Respiratory: {{respiratory findings}}
```

When you speak the audio trigger, this text is inserted with the first placeholder selected and ready for input.

## Tips for Effective Macros

- Keep audio triggers short and distinct (2–3 words).
- Avoid triggers that sound like common clinical phrases.
- Use placeholders for fields that change between patients.
- Single-line macros without placeholders are inserted inline; multi-line macros start on a new line.
