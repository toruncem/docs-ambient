Commure Dictation uses global hotkeys that work even when the application is minimized or in the background.

## Default Hotkeys

| Action | Default Hotkey | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Press & Hold | `Ctrl + Space` | Hold to dictate, release to stop |
| Start Dictation | `Ctrl + Shift + D` | Press to start dictation |
| Stop Dictation | `Ctrl + Shift + D` | Press to stop dictation |
| Cancel Dictation | `Ctrl + Shift + Escape` | Cancel without saving (disabled by default) |

## Changing a Hotkey

1. Navigate to **Settings > Dictation Preferences**.
2. Find the action you want to customize.
3. Click the **edit icon** next to the current hotkey.
4. Press your desired key combination.
5. Click **Save**.

## Enabling or Disabling Hotkeys

Each hotkey has a toggle switch. Turn off hotkeys you don't use to avoid accidental activation.

## Resetting to Defaults

Click **Reset to Defaults** at the top of the Dictation Preferences screen to restore all hotkeys to their original settings.
