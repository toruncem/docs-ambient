The Personal Dictionary automatically corrects words that are frequently misheard during transcription. When the system hears the "misspelled" version, it automatically substitutes your preferred spelling.

## Adding a Dictionary Entry

1. Navigate to **Settings > Personal Dictionary**.
2. In the **Misspelled/Heard As** field, enter the word as it's typically transcribed (e.g., "doctor smith").
3. In the **Correct Text** field, enter your preferred version (e.g., "Dr. Smith").
4. Click **Add**.
