## Introduction

Commure Dictation is a next-generation, point-and-click dictation desktop application designed for clinicians who rely on voice input throughout their day. Unlike traditional dictation tools that require specific integrations, Commure Dictation works with **any EHR or application**—simply click into a text field, press your hotkey, and start speaking.
