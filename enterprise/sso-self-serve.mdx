## Setup Process

1. **Open the Admin Panel**  
   Go to **Admin Panel → Single Sign-On**.

2. **Configure Your Identity Provider (IdP)**  
   Use the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** provided in the app to set up a SAML 2.0 connection in your IdP (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace).

3. **Get Your SSO URL**  
   Copy the SAML 2.0 endpoint URL from your IdP and paste it into the **SSO URL** field in the app.

4. **Get Your Certificate**  
   Download the X.509 certificate from your IdP and convert it to **Base64** format. Paste it into the **Certificate** field in the app.

5. **Test the Connection**  
   Use the **Test with Your User Account** button to verify that your SSO configuration is correct.  
   This is a **safe test** that will not affect existing user sessions.

6. **Save and Enable**  
   Once testing succeeds, click **Save and Enable SSO** to activate SSO for all users on your site.

## Required SAML Configuration

Your IdP’s **SAML Response** must include the following attributes:

- `NameID` → Email  
- `email` → Email  

Both are required.  
Without these attributes, SSO login will fail. Please confirm your IdP is configured to send them.

---

## ACS URL

You will see a copyable text box with the endpoint your IdP will use to send SAML responses.  
It will look something like this:

Use this exact value from the Admin Panel in your IdP’s **Reply URL**, **Assertion Consumer Service URL**, or **ACS endpoint** configuration.

---

## Testing and Enabling

- Click **Run Test** to verify your SSO configuration.  
- The test uses your current user account and will **not** log you out or disrupt other users.  
- Once the test succeeds, click **Save and Enable SSO** to activate it for your entire site.

> **Tip:** Work with your IT team to ensure proper SAML configuration before enabling SSO globally.

## Supported Identity Providers

We support any IdP compliant with **SAML 2.0**, including:

- Okta  
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- Google Workspace  
- Auth0  
- OneLogin  

---

## Security

- All SAML communications are **encrypted in transit** using HTTPS.  
- Certificates are stored **securely and encrypted**.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your IdP is passing in **email** and **NameID** exactly as specified above.  
- Double-check that your **ACS URL** matches what’s shown in the Admin Panel. Otherwise, it might silently fail because we can't even reach your side.
- If testing fails, verify the **SSO URL** is reachable, formatted correctly, and that the certificate is valid (not expired or malformed).
