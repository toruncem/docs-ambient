## Security & Compliance

Athelas Scribe is built with security, privacy, and compliance at its core. We offer a robust suite of security features to safeguard patient data and give providers full control over access, retention, and authentication.

---

### Authentication & Access

- **Face ID (iOS)**
  Use Face ID to quickly and securely log in to the Athelas Scribe mobile app without typing a password.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  Add an extra layer of protection by enabling MFA. After entering your password, youâ€™ll be prompted to verify your identity with a secure 6-digit code sent to your email.
- **Auto Logout**
  Sessions automatically time out after a period of inactivity, reducing the risk of unauthorized access on unattended devices.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
  SSO is supported for organizations that want to simplify secure logins using identity providers like Okta or Azure AD.
- **SCIM Integration**
  Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning via SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), ensuring your staff roster stays in sync with your identity provider.

### Retention & Data Lifecycle

Admins and users can control how long data is retained across different categories:

- **Transcripts**
  Automatically delete text transcripts after a set period (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days).
- **Audio Recordings**
  Choose to store or auto-delete recordings after transcription to reduce storage risk.
- **Notes**
  Set rules for how long clinical notes are stored in the system, aligning with your orgâ€™s compliance standards.

> ðŸ”§ These retention settings can be configured in the **Preferences** panel under **Data Management**.

- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
