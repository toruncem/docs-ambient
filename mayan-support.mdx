## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
The Support tab is implemented as a button in the navigation that triggers a modal overlay:

```html
<button class="support-btn" onclick="openSupportModal()">Support</button>
```

### CSS Styling
The modal uses the same dark theme as the Commure Ambient documentation:
- Background: `#1a1a1a`
- Text: `#ffffff` and `#a0a0a0`
- Accent: `#6366f1` (purple)
- Borders: `#2a2a2a`

### JavaScript Functionality
- Modal open/close with smooth animations
- Form validation and submission handling
- File attachment support
- Keyboard navigation
- Auto-resizing textarea

## Customization

### Changing Support Email
Update the email address in `index.html`:
```html
<span>You can also email us at <strong>support@ambient.commure.com</strong></span>
```

### Modifying Modal Content
Edit the modal content in the `#supportModal` section of `index.html`.

### Styling Adjustments
Modify the modal styles in `styles.css` under the "Modal Styles" section.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Integration with Existing Site

To integrate this Support tab with an existing Commure Ambient documentation site:

1. **Add the Support Button**: Include the support button in your navigation
2. **Include Modal HTML**: Add the modal HTML structure to your page
3. **Import Styles**: Include the modal-specific CSS
4. **Import Scripts**: Include the JavaScript functionality
5. **Customize**: Adjust styling and content to match your specific needs

## Backend Integration

The current implementation simulates form submission. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace the `sendQuestion()` function in `script.js`
2. Add proper API endpoints for question submission
3. Implement file upload functionality
4. Add proper error handling and success states
