### What it does:

Macros empowers providers to independently create and modify Physical Exam and Review of Systems sections within their note with pre-defined content. 

**The pre-defined content can be:**

- **Static** **Macro** – contains fixed text content that **does not** include placeholders. The content is injected into the final note as is and nothing additional should be added.

<Note>
  While dot phrases and static macros both deal with static text, the difference lies in how they’re inserted into the note. Static macros should typically be independent sentences/paragraphs. Dot phrases are best for small phrases that are applied throughout a paragraph/note.
</Note>

- **Dynamic Macro** – contains placeholders for dynamic values that are filled in based on the transcription.

This reduces the amount of time providers spend on editing and including visit information. Additionally, it automates the process of customizing patient records, ensuring that generalized note templates are transformed into highly specific, clinically relevant notes that reflect the individual patient's condition and the details discussed during the visit.

### How to Use it:

To create and use a macros, navigate to your **AI Studio** and press the **Custom Formatting** tab, then:

1. Select the note template you wish to add a macro to
2. Select the template section the macro will be added to and select "Add Macro"
   - If the same macro is required in multiple sections, it must be added individually to each section.

     <Note>
       Currently macros can only be created for the Physical Exam and Review of Systems secions and each section can have a maximum of 10 macros.
     </Note>
3. Create your macro
   - Enter the Exam Name and Macro Content (including age range and patient genger are optional)
4. Save your newly created macros by selecting the black "Save" button at the bottom of your macro window
5. During your visit, explicitly mention the exam name to trigger the macro. The macro will then appear in the generated scribe and you can toggle the hightlight feature on to see the dynamic values that were added within it.
