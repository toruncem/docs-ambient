## Carry Forward

**Carry Forward** helps providers save time by using relevant information from a patient’s previous visit note to pre-fill the new note for their current visit.

This feature is particularly useful for follow-ups or recurring visits, where much of the patient's history or previous assessments are still relevant.

---

### What Gets Carried Forward?

Each section in your note (e.g. Plan, Objective, Subjective, etc.) can behave differently depending on how the template is configured and what selections you make. Here's what may happen and what you can choose:

- **Clone:** Ignores new input; uses only the previous note’s content.
- **Prepend:** Previous content is copied and new content is added at the end.
- **Append:** Places the previous note’s content after the new content.
- **Blend:** Old and new content are merged together in a cohesive way.

---

### Use Carry Forward

- **EHR-Integrated Sites**: Once configured, carry forward will appear for eligble notes. The new note is automatically created using content from the previous visit. You’ll be taken directly to the editing screen with carried-forward data already populated.
- **Non-Integrated Sites**: Selecting **Carry Forward **from the**AI Actions**  menu of the patient's previous note, opens the new recording page for the current visit of that same pateint, with the previous note loaded as context. The system uses this to generate the new note once a new recording is generated.

### Set Up Carry Forward:

User Defined Rules:

1. Go to ****AI Actions thenCarry Forward****
2. Click on the **\+ Add Configuration **button.
3. Create carry forward rule mapping between two template.
4. By default, all rules between the templates are disabled. You need to configure the rules using the UI.
5. Configure custom user defined rules.
6. Now that you have setup custom user rules, navigate to the **My Scribes** page and select a note that was created using the source template (based on the rules you defined).
7. Then, continue to steps 2-6 listed in the section below.

Template Level Rules:

1. Go to an already existing Scribe with a SOAP template.
2. Click on ****AI Actions ****then****Carry Forward.**** 
3. Ensure you are using the correct template for the new scribe.
4. View the previous note.
5. Create a scribe. Ensure you have enough details for the sections with carry forward.
6. Once the new scribe is generated, you should see the **Compare View** button which you can toggle to view difference.

### Smart Logic

Carry Forward uses an advanced language model (LLM) to intelligently decide what to include, how to merge past content, and when to regenerate a section completely. Behind the scenes, the system:

- Uses **guideline prompts** to guide behavior section by section
- Applies **system and user roles** in the AI call to ensure accurate, role-specific output
- Executes logic modularly to optimize performance and ensure consistent structure

---

### Benefits

- Saves time on repetitive documentation
- Ensures continuity between visits
- Reduces errors by keeping relevant context
- Works with both manual and EHR-integrated workflows

<Tip>
  Users no longer need to navigate to \*\*My Scribes → AI Actions → Carry Forward. \*\*The previous signed note from the EHR is automatically pulled into our system, allowing the user to start a visit with carry forward already in place.
