## Carry Forward

**Carry Forward** helps providers save time by using relevant information from a patient’s previous visit note to pre-fill the new note for their current visit.

This feature is particularly useful for follow-ups or recurring visits, where much of the patient's history or previous assessments are still relevant.

---

### How It Works

When you select **Carry Forward** from the AI Actions menu:

- **Integrated Sites**:
  The new note is automatically created using content from the previous visit. You’ll be taken directly to the editing screen with carried-forward data already populated.
- **Non-Integrated Sites**:
  Selecting **Carry Forward** opens the new recording page with the previous note loaded as context. The system uses this to generate the new note once a new recording is completed.

### What Gets Carried Forward?

Each section in your note (e.g. Plan, Objective, Subjective, etc.) can behave differently depending on how the template is configured and what selections you make. Here's what may happen and what you can choose:

- **Regenerate: **Section id freshly written based on new context (no carry forward).
- **Carry Forward Only: **Section is copied exactly from the previous note (no new content).
- **Carry Forward and Append:** Previous content is copied and new content is added at the end.
- **Carry Forward and Blend: **Old and new content are merged together in a cohesive way.

### Smart Logic

Carry Forward uses an advanced language model (LLM) to intelligently decide what to include, how to merge past content, and when to regenerate a section completely. Behind the scenes, the system:

- Uses **guideline prompts** to guide behavior section by section
- Applies **system and user roles** in the AI call to ensure accurate, role-specific output
- Executes logic modularly to optimize performance and ensure consistent structure

### Benefits

- Ensures continuity between visits
- Reduces errors by keeping relevant context
- Works with both manual and EMR-integrated workflows
