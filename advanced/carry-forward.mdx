## Carry Forward

**Carry Forward** helps providers save time by using relevant information from a patient’s previous visit note to pre-fill the new note for their current visit.

This feature is particularly useful for follow-ups or recurring visits, where much of the patient's history or previous assessments are still relevant.

### How It Works

When you select **Carry Forward** from the AI Actions menu:

- **Integrated Sites**:
  The new note is automatically created using content from the previous visit. You’ll be taken directly to the editing screen with carried-forward data already populated.
- **Non-Integrated Sites**:
  Selecting **Carry Forward** opens the new recording page with the previous note loaded as context. The system uses this to generate the new note once a new recording is completed.

### What Gets Carried Forward?

Each section in your note (e.g. Plan, Objective, Subjective) can behave differently depending on how the template is configured. Here's what may happen:

- `REGENERATE`: Section is freshly written based on new context (no carry forward).
- `CARRY_FORWARD_ONLY`: Section is copied exactly from the previous note (no new content).
- `CARRY_FORWARD_AND_APPEND`: Previous content is copied and new content is added at the end.
- `CARRY_FORWARD_AND_BLEND` (New\!): Old and new content are merged together in a cohesive way.

### Smart Logic

Carry Forward uses an advanced language model (LLM) to intelligently decide what to include, how to merge past content, and when to regenerate a section completely. Behind the scenes, the system:

- Uses **guideline prompts** to guide behavior section by section
- Applies **system and user roles** in the AI call to ensure accurate, role-specific output
- Executes logic modularly to optimize performance and ensure consistent structure
