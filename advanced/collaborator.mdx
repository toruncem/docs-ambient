## Collaborator View

**Collaborator View** enables human scribes and assistants to work seamlessly with multiple providers from a single account. It supports flexible delegation while maintaining provider-level control over templates, formatting, and appointment data.

### What is Collaborator Mode?

When a user selects **“All Collaborators”** or a specific provider name from the Visits dropdown, they enter **Collaborator Mode**. This view shows all appointments for providers the user is linked to, allowing them to record notes on behalf of those providers.

---

### Key Access Rules

- **Collaborators only see templates that the provider has access to.**
  This keeps the UI clean and provider-specific.
- **Collaborators can record with templates they don’t have access to,** but:
  - They **cannot view the note afterward** if it’s from a restricted template.
  - The **provider will still have full access** to view and edit the note.
- **Custom formatting and dot phrases come from the provider’s account** if the collaborator starts recording from an appointment.
  - If the scribe is recorded **without linking to an appointment**, the collaborator’s own preferences are used instead.

---

### My Scribes in Collaborator Mode

- Collaborators can see all scribes they recorded.
- Each scribe shows the **associated provider** (if it was tied to a provider's appointment).
- Collaborators can **edit, regenerate, and EHR sync** notes as usual.

---

### Provider Visibility

- Providers can also see notes recorded by collaborators for their appointments.
- Providers can:
  - **View, edit, regenerate, and sync** the note.
  - See the **sync status** of the scribe (e.g., if a collaborator synced it).
  - See the appointment marked as **Completed**.

---

### Archiving Behavior

- Deleting a scribe from the frontend **archives it from both collaborator and provider views**.
- Archiving does not delete the scribe permanently but removes it from default views.

---

### Collaboration Flexibility

- A single provider can have **multiple collaborators**.
- A single collaborator can be linked to **multiple providers**.
- This supports shared documentation workflows in busy clinics or hospitalist environments.
