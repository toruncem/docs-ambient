## Overview

The Ambient AI API v2 enables you to integrate ambient AI documentation capabilities into your applications. With this API, you can:

- **Authenticate** using OAuth2 password flow

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.staging.commure.com/ambient/scribe
```

## API Versioning

The API uses versioning in the URL path. This is version `v2`, which uses the following path pattern:

```
/v1/{endpoint}
```

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. To authenticate:

1. Obtain a JWT token using the [authentication endpoint](/api-reference/authentication)
2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_jwt_token}
```

## Request Format

Most endpoints accept JSON (`application/json`) or form data (`multipart/form-data` for file uploads). Content-Type headers are required for POST requests.

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Success responses include relevant data, while error responses include error details in a consistent format.

## Rate Limits

API rate limits may apply depending on your subscription tier.
