## Overview

The Ambient AI Scribe API enables you to integrate ambient AI documentation capabilities into your applications. With this API, you can:

- **Authenticate** using OAuth2 password flow
- **Transcribe** audio files into text
- **Generate clinical notes** from audio or transcripts using customizable templates
- **Manage scribe jobs** with status tracking and regeneration capabilities
- **Submit feedback** to improve note quality

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://rcm-api.athelas.com
```

## API Versioning

The API uses versioning in the URL path. The current version is `v1`, which is included in all endpoint paths:

```
/v1/ambient/api/{endpoint}
```

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. To authenticate:

1. Obtain a JWT token using the [authentication endpoint](/api-reference/authentication)
2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_jwt_token}
```

## Request Format

Most endpoints accept JSON (`application/json`) or form data (`multipart/form-data` for file uploads). Content-Type headers are required for POST requests.

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Success responses include relevant data, while error responses include error details in a consistent format.

## Rate Limits

API rate limits may apply depending on your subscription tier. Rate limit headers are included in responses to help you manage your usage.
